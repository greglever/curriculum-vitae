%
To whom it may concern,
%

I would very much like to be considered for the role of Science Researcher at DeepMind.

%
I have a broad range of scientific interests
which began developing during my school years
thanks to some inspirational
science teachers.
%
I fondly remember an 
electronics A-level class back in 2004 where I 
built an analog perceptron circuit and trained 
simple logic gates. It wasn't anything groundbreaking 
but to see that you could train a circuit to produce 
an output you wanted, without having to hard-code 
any rules, just blew my mind. 
%
At this time, I was fascinated by quantum computing 
and quantum mechanics, motivating me to study 
Theoretical Physics at UCL.
%

The scientific publications I have been involved with further
demonstrate my wide interests. 
In the third year of my undergraduate degree I led a 
team of my colleagues to discover an 
Exoplanet\cite{habitable}. 
I would continue this collaboration\cite{exofit_mnras} 
while working on my PhD in another subject. 
The summer following my third year of undergrad 
I worked in the London Centre for Nanotechnology as a 
research intern. After studying the fundamentals 
of Density-Functional Theory and Quantum Mechanics in my 
degree I applied these in 
Materials Science, specifically Silicon surfaces at the 
atomic scale \cite{stm_aps} with the overall aim
of furthering our understanding of how we can form 
individual atomistic nanowires, providing an alternative
to conventional Silicon chips as Moore's Law
reaches its physical limits.
%
I continued in this direction for my Masters 
dissertation which formed the basis of a 
publication collaborating with
experimentalists\cite{prb_silicon}.
%

%
For my PhD I shifted my focus more towards biology. 
%
Following graduate training in the foundations of 
Computational Biology I published first-name author
works considering some of the fundamental challenges
in applying a combination of 
quantum and classical mechanics-based techniques
to proteins\cite{jpcm} and then applied these techniques 
to accurately describe the reaction of an enzyme\cite{jpcl},
one of the class of proteins fundamental for life.
%
My thesis was nominated as an outstanding
PhD thesis by the University of Cambridge
and subsequently published by 
Springer\cite{springer_thesis}.
%
Following my PhD I accepted a position as a 
Postdoctoral Research Associate at MIT\cite{mit}. 
%
Aside from my research investigating 
how mutations in enzyme sequences affect catalysis,
my post doc involved mentoring
the junior members of the research group along
with the integration and loading of 
large public biological databases 
into the workflow of the group from sources 
such as the National Centre for Biotechnology 
Information and 
Protein Data Bank.
%
On the teaching side of my post doc I developed material for 
delivering graduate computational chemistry 
lectures.
%

%
Frustrated by the slow pace of academia
and lack of wider impact outside of my 
small research community, combined with the desire to
work in a more product-led environment, I decided to apply 
for the Faculty fellowship programme.
%
% This initiative helps academics become 
% highly-skilled data scientists and 
% transition successfully into careers 
% and industries that are ready to benefit 
% from artificial intelligence. 
%
% After two weeks of intensive lectures and 
% workshops at Faculty, where I learned how to apply 
% my technical knowledge towards the application of 
% data science, I was paired with a company 
% for a six-week data science project who subsequently 
% hired me. 
%
The fellowship included two weeks of 
intensive lectures and workshops at Faculty, 
where I learned how to apply 
my technical knowledge towards the application of 
data science.
% 
I was then paired with a company 
for a six-week data science project and they subsequently 
hired me.
%
Working within this company and 
later another technology start-up in London
I was building consumer-facing Machine-Learning
products. 
%
I also spoke at Big Data Week London, co-hosting 
a panel on How to Become an Effective Data Scientist\cite{BDW}.

%
An opportunity then arose to join the team at 
Genomics England in their efforts to sequence
and analyse 100,000 genomes from NHS patients.
%
This was a chance for me to further develop my
bioinformatics and molecular genetics skills developed
during my PhD and postdoc.
%
My work in the bioinformatics team 
on the 100,000 Genomes Project was 
acknowledged in a British Medical Journal publication\cite{gel_bmj}.
%
Following the completion of the 100K project
I joined IQVIA who has a unique data partnership
with Genomics England and where I am the ML 
lead for the in silico clinical trials project.
%
I also collaborate with IQVIA's ML researchers
and our most recent work 
has been accepted for the next AAAI conference\cite{conan} 
(this year with an acceptance rate 
of 20.6\%).
%

%
I feel the state of Machine Learning and AI at the 
moment is akin to the release of the IBM PC or the Apple II.
%
An example is the emergence of the first real spreadsheet 
software, enabling people to deal with 
financial data, customer data and so forth in a much 
more intuitive way than would have been possible on a mainframe. 
%
Being able to use statistical-learning techniques, 
machine-learning approaches or to train 
computational neural nets 
makes a lot of decades-old problems much 
more tractable.
%
A part of the Science Researcher role 
I would relish is the unique opportunity 
to participate in the Domain Expert Embedding Programme
and to have the chance to learn from world-leading researchers from 
DeepMind and beyond.
%
I firmly believe DeepMind 
is one of very 
few companies that has both socially and 
intellectually significant problems in its sights 
and that's why I really want to be a part of 
your journey and apply my scientific skills to furthering
DeepMind's vision.
% 

~\\
I look forward to hearing from you.
